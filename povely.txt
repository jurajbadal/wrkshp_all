#1 run all together
docker-compose up

#2 run each tool independently
docker-compose up playwright
docker-compose up k6
docker-compose up newman
docker-compose up python
docker-compose up robotframework

#3 Scale specific services
docker-compose up --scale k6=3

#4 Benefits of this approach:
Each container is smaller and more focused.
You can update or modify each component independently.
It's easier to manage dependencies for each tool separately.
You can run only the services you need for a particular task.

#5 Considerations:
Ensure proper networking if the services need to communicate.
You may need to set up shared volumes or other mechanisms 
for sharing data between containers if required.

#6 Resume
This approach provides a more flexible, maintainable, and scalable 
solution, especially for complex testing or automation scenarios.

#HOW TO work from each folder:
#7 builds from each own folder
docker build -t k6-all .
docker build -t newman-all .
docker build -t python39-all .
docker build -t robotframework-all .
docker build -t cypress-all .

#8 How to run each of them
docker run --rm -i k6-all run script.js
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app newman-all run mycollection.json
docker run --rm -i python39-all python hello_world.py
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/tests:/tests -v $(pwd)/results:/results robotframework-all
docker run -it -v $PWD:/cypress -w /cypress cypress-all npx cypress run

#HOW to run it from root folder using COMPOSE
#9 BUILD with compose
docker-compose build k6
docker-compose build newman
docker-compose build python39
docker-compose build robotframework
docker-compose build cypress

#10 RUN BUILDS with compose
docker-compose run --rm k6 run script.js
docker-compose run --rm newman run mycollection.json
docker-compose run --rm python39 python hello_world.py
docker-compose run --rm robotframework
docker-compose run --rm cypress 


#11 how to build and run all from the root folder using COMPOSE
